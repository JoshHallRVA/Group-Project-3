<h2> Future development </h2>

- Garage "Sailors" are the future. 

- The "Sailors" will bridge the gap between the traditional old-fashioned garage sale and the online shopping community.  Just because someone has a garage sale, doesn't mean they have the time, means, or even just the desire, to post all of their things online.  The "sailor" takes care of that for them by posting items they find while out garage sailing.  

- There is an opportunity to incentivize sailors to improve their skills once the app gains traction. 

- Buyers will be able to "follow" their favorite sellers or sailors, and even ask for them to be on the lookout for their specific treasures.
